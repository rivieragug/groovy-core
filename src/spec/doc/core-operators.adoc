= Operators

This chapter covers the operators of the Groovy programming language.

== Arithmetic operators

Groovy supports the usual familiar arithmetic operators you find in mathematics and in other programming languages like Java.
All the Java arithmetic operators are supported. Let's go through them in the following examples.

=== Normal arithmetic operators

The following binary arithmetic operators are available in Groovy:

[cols="1,1,1" options="header"]
|====
| Operator
| Purpose
| Remarks

| +++
| addition
|

| +-+
| substraction
|

| +*+
| multiplication
|

| +/+
| division
| Use +intdiv()+ for integer division, and see the section about <<core-syntax.adoc#integer_division,the integer division>> for more information on the return type of the division.

| +%+
| modulo
|

| +**+
| power
| See the section about <<core-syntax.adoc#power_operator,the power operation>> for more information on the return type of the operation.
|====

Here are a few examples of usage of those operators:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=binary_arith_ops,indent=0]
----

=== Unary operators

The +++ and +-+ operators are also available as unary operators:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=unary_plus_minus,indent=0]
----
<1> Note the usage of parentheses to surround an expression to apply the unary minus to that surrounded expression.

In terms of unary arithmetics operators, the ++++ (increment) and +--+ (decrement) operators are available, 
both in prefix and postfix notation:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=plusplus_minusminus,indent=0]
----
<1> The postfix increment will increment +a+ after the expression has been evaluated and assigned into +b+
<2> The postfix decrement will decrement +c+ after the expression has been evaluated and assigned into +d+
<3> The prefix increment will increment +e+ before the expression is evaluated and assigned into +f+
<4> The prefix decrement will decrement +g+ before the expression is evaluated and assigned into +h+

=== Assignment arithmetic operators

From the binary arithmetic operators we have seen above, certain of them are also available in an assignment form:

* ++=+
* +-=+
* +*=+
* +/=+
* +%=+

Let's see them in action:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=binary_assign_operators,indent=0]
----

== Relational operators

Relational operators allow comparisons between objects, to know if two objects are the same or different,
or if one is greater or lower than or equal to the other.

The following operators are available:

[cols="1,1" options="header"]
|====
| Operator
| Purpose

| +==+
| equal

| +!=+
| different

| +<+
| less than

| `<=`
| less than or equal

| +>+
| greater than

| +>=+
| greater than or equal
|====

These operators into action in simple number comparisons:
